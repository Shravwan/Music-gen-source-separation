# Music Generation & Source Separation

A machine learning project for separating musical instruments (flute and violin) from audio using deep learning models. This repository contains tools for dataset creation, model training, and source separation inference.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements source separation for classical music by identifying and isolating specific instruments (flute and violin) from mixed audio. It leverages pre-trained models and custom classifiers to extract individual instrument tracks from complex musical compositions.

## 🎯 Features

- **Instrument Isolation**: Separate flute and violin tracks from mixed audio
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes trained models for both flute and violin detection
- **Dataset Creation**: Scripts for generating training datasets from audio files
- **Music Tagging**: Automatic detection and classification of instrument presence
- **Gender-based Splitting**: Separate audio by detected gender characteristics
- **Source Separation**: Advanced audio separation pipeline using neural networks
